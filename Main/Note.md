# Notes

1. The model generally get convergent with only a few day's data(even one day)
2. The model can be very easy in such a large scale
3. Consider add more hidden state for it
4. MDN can't convergent without recurrent unit
5. In old metrics GRU_MDN performed well.
6. I have to realize some SOTA model and compare my model with them.
   1. ConvLSTM
   2. STGCN
   3. HA
   4. ARIMA
   5. SARIMA
